## Summary
In this project, I built a web app where you can register as a new colonist on a planet. I used Angular JS to build the app, 
as well as CSS and Typescript. In my web app, there is a home page, registration form, encounters, and reports. We also used 
local storage in our dev tools to save our projects.

## Languages and tools I used: 
Angular JS
